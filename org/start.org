#+TITLE: Emacs 24 configuration for Clinton Dreisbach
#+AUTHOR: Clinton Dreisbach

* Introduction
** Standards
   Emacs does not have namespaces, so you should come up with some
   prefix for your variables and functions to avoid
   conflicts. Luckily, =/= is a valid character in Emacs symbols, so I
   emulate Clojure namespaces by using this. I use the prefix =cnd=
   (my initials), so a custom function I write would have a name like
   this: =cnd/gain-ultimate-power=.

* Personal Info
   Emacs will try and guess information about you from your
   environment. I prefer to be explicit about it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq user-full-name "Clinton N. Dreisbach")
  (setq user-mail-address "clinton@dreisbach.us")
#+end_src

* Must-Have Configuration
  There are a few settings that any user of Emacs should have. You do
  want the power of =cl=, which brings in a lot of Common Lisp's
  methods.  You do want Emacs to reload changed files if you haven't
  also changed them in Emacs (=global-auto-revert-mode=). You want
  winner-mode, because you are a winner.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'cl)
  (global-auto-revert-mode t)
  (winner-mode t)
#+end_src

* GUI Settings
  Emacs' default GUI settings are not great ones. No one wants to see
  the Emacs splash screen. Everyone wants to see what text is selected
  (=transient-mark-mode=). Other GUI setings will be based on personal
  preferences. I personally don't want to see a tool bar, a scroll
  bar, a menu bar, or really, any kind of bar. I also don't want Emacs
  to make me type out "yes" or "no" when a "y" or "n" will
  suffice. Right now, I like =visual-line-mode=, which makes word wrap
  way better in Emacs, but I go back and forth on it. Lastly, I like
  seeing where my files end, so I toggle on =indicate-empty-lines=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq inhibit-splash-screen t)
  (transient-mark-mode t)
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
  (global-visual-line-mode t)
  (if (not indicate-empty-lines)
    (toggle-indicate-empty-lines))  
#+end_src

** Modeline Improvements
   I like having the column number in my modeline to help with stack
   traces and just as a sanity check.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq column-number-mode t)
#+end_src

* Backups
   Default Emacs behavior around backups dates from a time of
   barbarism and should be avoided. On the other hand, it's saved me
   once or twice. Therefore, I allow Emacs to keep backups, but
   instead of keeping them in the same directory as the file being
   edited, I force them to be kept in a temporary directory.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq backup-directory-alist `((".*" . ,temporary-file-directory)))
  (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms `((".*" ,temporary-file-directory t)))
#+end_src
  
* Files and Directories
  I like to set up a vendor directory for any random elisp files I
  pull in. I get the majority of my functionality from packages
  distributed through ELPA or Marmalade, but sometimes, you find
  something random on EmacsWiki that you may want to pull in. After
  adding that directory, you're going to want to throw it in your
  load-path. Often, you'll have subdirectories in your vendor
  directory. Go ahead and add those to the load-path as well.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar cnd/vendor-dir (expand-file-name "vendor" user-emacs-directory)
    "Location of any random elisp files I find from other authors.")
  (add-to-list 'load-path cnd/vendor-dir)
  
  (dolist (project (directory-files cnd/vendor-dir t "\\w+"))
    (when (file-directory-p project)
      (add-to-list 'load-path project)))
#+end_src

* Packages
** Package Repositories
   In addition to the default ELPA package repository, I use Marmalade,
   which is community-run and has new packages more quickly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load "package")
  (package-initialize)

  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
#+end_src

** Packages to Install
  There's no way I can list each package I use and why here. The
  important thing to note is that I set up a var with a list of the
  packages I want to have installed.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar cnd/packages '(anything
                        anything-config
                        auto-complete
                        auto-indent-mode
                        autopair
                        clojure-mode
                        coffee-mode
                        cperl-mode
                        deft
                        feature-mode
                        find-file-in-git-repo
                        find-file-in-project
                        full-ack
                        go-mode
                        gist
                        haml-mode
                        htmlize
                        ido-ubiquitous
                        magit
                        markdown-mode
                        marmalade
                        nrepl
                        org2blog
                        paredit
                        sass-mode
                        scss-mode
                        slime
                        slime-repl
                        smex
                        solarized-theme
                        yaml-mode
                        xml-rpc)
    "Packages I always want installed.")
#+end_src
  
** Installing Packages   
   This is the magic incantation to get your packages installed. It
   will require a network connection if you don't have all your
   packages currently installed, but otherwise, does not make any
   connections.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun cnd/packages-installed-p ()
    (loop for pkg in cnd/packages
          when (not (package-installed-p pkg)) do (return nil)
          finally (return t)))
  
  (unless (cnd/packages-installed-p)
    (message "%s" "Refreshing package database...")
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (dolist (pkg cnd/packages)
    (when (not (package-installed-p pkg))
      (package-install pkg))))
#+end_src

    "Save the buffer even if it is not modified."
    (interactive)
    (set-buffer-modified-p t)
    (save-buffer))
  
  ;;; Local config
  (let ((local-config (expand-file-name "local.el" user-config-dir)))
    (when (file-exists-p local-config)
      (load local-config)))
