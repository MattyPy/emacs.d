It is not guaranteed,\r\nor even likely, that it will work with anything less than that.\r\n\r\nI've redone my Emacs config several times over the years, and this is not\r\ngoing to be my last time.\r\n\r\n## Values and Goals\r\n\r\nMy #1 value to impress on this config is simplicity. If I can get away\r\nwith not including something, I will.\r\n\r\nMy #1 goal when writing this config is to learn Emacs Lisp better. I know\r\nScheme (particularly PLT Racket) pretty well, but I don't really know Emacs \r\nLisp.\r\n\r\n","name":"Emacs.d","google":""}
