* My Emacs Configuration
  This configuration is meant to be used with Emacs 24. It is not guaranteed,
  or even likely, that it will work with anything less than that.

  I've redone my Emacs config several times over the years, and this is not
  going to be my last time. Previously, I was using version 2 of the 
  [[http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit][Emacs Starter Kit]] with my own modifications, and that worked well, but I
  didn't always know where all the behaviors were coming from, so I started
  over.

** Values and Goals
   My #1 value to impress on this config is simplicity. If I can get away
   with not including something, I will.

   My #1 goal when writing this config is to learn Emacs Lisp better. I know
   Scheme (particularly PLT Racket) pretty well, but I don't really know Emacs 
   Lisp.
